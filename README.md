# Beginner-JS-exercices

This is a collection of small JavaScript scripts using Vanilla JavaScript. They are the answers to a list of 150 exercises named "JavaScript basic - Exercises, Practice, Solution" on the [W3 Resoucerce page](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php).

They include topics such as:
* if/else statements
* array methods 
* date objects
* numbers
* strings
* higher-order functions
* ternary operators
* ... and more

The exercises are meant to use logic combined with basic JS syntax and formulate answers to common programming tasks.  

The answers are my own, and I have included code comments and resources where possible.
