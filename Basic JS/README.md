## Beginner JavaScript exercices

This is a collection of small JavaScript scripts using Vanilla JavaScript. They are the answers to a list of 150 exercises named "JavaScript basic - Exercises, Practice, Solution" on the [W3 Resource page](https://www.w3resource.com/index.php).

They include topics such as:

1) if/else statements
2) *array methods
3) date objects
4) numbers
5) strings
6) higher-order functions
7) ternary operators

The exercises are meant to use logic combined with basic JS syntax and formulate answers to common programming tasks.

The answers are my own, and I have included code comments and resources where possible.
